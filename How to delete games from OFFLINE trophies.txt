How to delete games from OFFLINE trophies.

Disclaimer: This worked for me. Keep a backup of everything you modify or delete. I have NO idea about online trophies, synching or whatever. This is OFFLINE only!

- Copy /user/home/xxxxxxxx/trophy/db/trophy_local.db from PS4 FTP to your PC
- Open trophy_local.db using SQLite viewer
- Switch to tab "Browse Data", then open table "tbl_trophy_title".
- Scroll right to the column "title", filter for the game you want to remove, e.g. "sonic" to see all Sonic games. Scroll back left, note the "trophy_title_id" (NPWRxxxxx_00) for the title you want to delete.
- Remove all filters, then go through all tables of the database:
| - Filter each table's "trophy_title_id" by the NPWRxxxxx value you found
| - Select all rows that remain by selecting the numbers on the very left of the window, right-click, "Delete Records"
- Click "Write Changes", then "Close Database"
- Copy the changed database back to /user/home/xxxxxxxx/trophy/db, rename the copy there first
- Navigate to /user/home/xxxxxxxx/trophy/data/. Delete the NPWRxxxxx folder with the same NPWR number you deleted in the database.
- Repeat for /user/trophy/conf/, delete the NPWRxxxxx folder.

Make sure you backup the database and the both NPWR folders before deleting them in case anything goes wrong.

You can do this with several games at once, of course.
